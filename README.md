# Library ðŸ“š ðŸ“– ðŸ“™<br>
**On this personal project i've decided to create a library, where you can store your books names, author and release date.<br>**
**You also can delete and update.**

*Once using this project you're going to have to download some expecifics sets of library*


# Follow the following steps:

*1Âº Download PostgreSQL Database to store your books. <br>*
*2Âº Install Sequelize to establish the connection with your database. Use "npm install --save sequelize" on your terminal. <br>*
*3Âº Install EJS which is going to be view engine for static files. Use "npm install --save ejs" on your terminal. <br>*
*4Âº Install express library, it is very important on this project. Use "npm install express --save" on your terminal. <br>*
*5Âº Install Typescript and types for express. Use "npm install -D typescript @types/express ts-node-dev" on your terminal. <br>*
*6Âº Install the Body-Parser to get data from front end. Use "npm install body-parser" on your terminal. <br>*
*7Âº Install PG to use PgAdmin on your PostgreSQL. Use "npm install pg" on your terminal. <br>*
*8Âº Install Types for express, as we using typescript you're going yo need this. Use "npm install --save @types/express" on your terminal. <br>*
*9Âº Install Sucrase. Use "npm install sucrase" on your terminal. <br>*
